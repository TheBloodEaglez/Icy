# Icy-
Best Perl Brute force generator
icy+ is an the idea for a program I had several years ago, but never got around writing it. 
icy+ uses strpos and a simple number generator to then "strpos" if you will,
 the location on the string. Logic is the second idea I had for a program it combines an algorithm and
 a principle I like to call Dave's algorithm and the law of passwords (I came up with both)
 Dave's algorithm is not really my idea all what it pretty much does is round, and you can use this
 to detect if a number repeats or not. For an example lets say you want to know if 333 repeated numbers 
 how would you do that? Well if you add all of them together than divide by the length of the characters 
 you want to know repeat you will get in this case a 3. So 3 plus 3? six (in this hypothetical we want 
 to know if two numbers repeat) 6 divided by two is three therefore 3 repeats. Now you may be wondering
 what this does and thats were the law of passwords comes in to play... How many passwords that either
 youve come up with or that a computer came up with (or a loved one) has more than three repeating characters in a row?
 from my experience none! Therefore we can conclude that someone running a bruteforce script waists most attempts due to for an example:
 aaab etc. By the way if your not convinced the law of passwords is a real thing ive left two other scripts in this project
 one was the proof of concept and the other is icy+ without logic
PS if someone could edit the Readme that would be nice also

Ps
So the Readme is for both the old password cracker and the new one and so things like Dave's algorithm (which the implementation in code has been lost) aren't used in the new password file (something similar)
